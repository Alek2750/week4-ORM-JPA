# ORM (Object Relational Mapping) with JPA (Java Persistence API)

## Business Competences
Be able to work with databases through an Object Relational Mapping Framework. The focus is on
java/JPA, but the core concepts are widely applicable in almost all technologies "out there".

### [Day 1](Day1) Introduction to ORM 
What/why is an ORM, install eclipselink+mysql dependencies, generate tables,
generate classes (reverse JPA), the persistence unit, the Entity class, the
EntityManager.

### Readings
  * [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping). Only read the first section, to get an overall idea about ORM. This is a concept you will find in almost all modern technologies (Java, .Net, JavaScipt, PHP etc..)
  * [Java Persistence](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence) (Wikibook). This should be your main reference for most of you JPA-related questions. 
* 3.3 [What is JPA](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence/What_is_JPA%3F)
* 3.7 [Why use JPA or ORM?](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence/Why_use_JPA_or_ORM%3F)
* 4.0 [Java Persistence/Persistence Products](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence/Persistence_Products) Skim only (we will be using EclipseLink)

### [Day 2](Day2) - Relationships 
Relationships, cardinality, directionality and Inheritance (only red students)

### [Day 3](Day3) - Inheritance and JPQL
JPQL-queries
